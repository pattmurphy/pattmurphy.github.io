      <h3>Algonquin College School of Advanced Technology</h3>
      <h4>Cyber Security Analysis - anticipated graduation April 2022</h4>
      <p>The Cyber Security Analysis program involves understanding how to secure technological infrastructure and perform practical analysis of a network. How to find and remediate vulnerabilities in a network, analyse logs to determine if the organization is compromised, and attack and probe networks are some of the key skills learned.</p>
      <p>My highlights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3.91 cumulative GPA.</li>
        <li>Hired by Employment and Social Development Canada for a coop term.</li>
        <li>Completed a full Business Continuity Plan for the YWCA Hamilton.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>George Brown School of Computer Technology</h3>
      <h4>Computer Programming and Analysis - 2019</h4>
      <p>The Computer Programming and Analysis program involves learning the foundations of the web, and some of the most popular programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C#, PHP, and Java. It also teaches object oriented principles, and how to put this all together to make large software projects in a team using agile methodologies. By the end, students are using frameworks like Angular and React to make fully functional applications fit for production. The program culminates in a year-long team project involving stakeholders where results must be delivered.</p>
      <p>My highlights include:</p>
