        Plan and develop the Literacy Uplift mobile and web applications within a team.
        These applications were designed to help people improve their literacy skills and 
        allow teachers to add practice exercises and monitor their students' progress.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collaborated with stakeholders and a team of five developers to create the Literacy Uplift web and mobile apps.</li>
        <li>Managed the flow and logic of the web application, including designing and developing views and controllers using PHP, HTML, and CSS with the Laravel and Bootstrap frameworks.</li>
        <li>Developed the web API, enabling mobile application access to database information with PHP, SQL, and JSON.</li>
        <li>Maintained the status of the web application’s online development and testing server with Apache and Linux.</li>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      
      <h3>George Brown School of Computer Technology</h3>
      <h4>Computer Programming and Analysis - 2019</h4>
      <p>The Computer Programming and Analysis program involves learning the foundations of the web, and some of the most popular programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C#, PHP, and Java. It also teaches object oriented principles, and how to put this all together to make large software projects in a team using agile methodologies. By the end, students are using frameworks like Angular and React to make fully functional applications fit for production. The program culminates in a year-long team project involving stakeholders where results must be delivered.</p>
      <p>My highlights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hired by George Brown Research and Innovation division for the Literacy Uplift project.</li>
        <li>Graduated on the Dean’s list with a 3.8 cumulative GPA and 4.0 final semester GPA.</li>
      </ul>
